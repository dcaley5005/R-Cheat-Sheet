# Sampling Deals

### Randomly pick 5 deals to ask if they are satisfied with the service they received.
### Setting a random seed shows that it can be reproduced in case you get asked how you chose the deals
### In this example it is better to use Without replacement
### If you sample with replacement, you might end up calling the same customer twice.
